# Gamethon 2025

The FIFS Sports Big Data Gamethon 2025 is an AI/ML-driven competition focused on optimizing fantasy cricket team selection for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 (Feb 19 - Mar 9, 2025). Participants are tasked with developing predictive models to maximize fantasy points by selecting the best possible teams based on historical performance, match conditions, and real-time constraints. Key data sources include the Cricinfo Stats Repository and Cricsheet, which provide comprehensive player and match statistics. The competition emphasizes understanding gameplay rules, budget constraints, and the fantasy points system, while identifying critical factors like player form, venue, and match conditions that influence team selection.

The primary goal of this project is to build an AI/ML model that dynamically predicts and selects optimal fantasy cricket teams, ensuring compliance with rules while maximizing points. Participants will analyze historical data to extract performance trends, engineer relevant features, and develop strategies for team optimization. By the end of the competition, successful models will demonstrate the ability to adapt to real-time match scenarios, providing a data-driven approach to fantasy cricket that balances player selection, budget management, and scoring potential. This notebook serves as a foundational guide, outlining the competition's objectives, data sources, and expected outcomes.
